## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Installation
```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e .

# Install with optional dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,vision,visualization,storage,nlp]"
```

### Usage
```bash
# Process diagrams
python -m diagram_processing process data/examples/diagram.png diagram_001

# Query with GraphRAG
python -m graph_rag search "find load balancers" diagram_001
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from diagram_processing import DiagramProcessor
from graph_rag import GraphRAG

# Process diagram
processor = DiagramProcessor()
result = processor.process("data/examples/diagram.png", "diagram_001")

# Query with GraphRAG
rag = GraphRAG()
results = rag.search("find database connections", "diagram_001")
```
